## About

Open With Browser is a desktop application that enhances link management by choosing the right browser and profile automatically based on user-defined rules.

Examples:

- Open all GitHub links in your ‚ÄúCoding‚Äù Chrome profile.
- Open IEEE Xplore links in your ‚ÄúUniversity‚Äù profile.

If a link doesn‚Äôt match any rule, a fallback ‚ÄúOpen With‚Äù dialog appears listing all detected browsers and their profiles. You can open ‚ÄúJust once‚Äù or create an ‚ÄúAlways‚Äù rule on the fly.

Key features:

- Rule-based routing by host, path, query, scheme, and more
- Automatic browser and profile discovery (Chrome/Edge/Brave/Firefox)
- Smart fallback dialog with ‚ÄúJust once‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlways‚Äù options
- Cross-platform via Tauri (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Import/export rules, optional telemetry, and audit logs

---

## Architecture (planned)

- Frontend: React + Vite (apps/desktop)
- Backend: Tauri v2 (Rust) with modular services
  - Rule Engine: evaluates URL ‚Üí Action (browser/profile)
  - Browser Discovery: finds installed browsers per OS
  - Profile Resolver: lists/launches profiles for Chromium/Firefox
  - Opener: spawns the selected browser with correct args
  - Registration: register as default handler for http/https
  - Storage: SQLite for rules/settings (planned)

---

## Prerequisites

Before running, make sure the following are installed:

- [Rust toolchain (stable)](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/v2/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/)
- [Node.js (optional)](https://nodejs.org/) ‚Äî only needed if using `npm`

> üí° **Tip:**
>
> - Windows users: install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) for Rust to compile.
> - Linux/macOS users: ensure you have `curl`, `pkg-config`, and `libgtk-3-dev` or equivalents.

For detailed requirements: [Tauri v2 Prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

## Quick Start

You can run this project with **Bun** or **npm**.  
Follow your platform-specific setup below üëá

---

### ü™ü Windows Setup (Bun + Tauri)

```powershell
# 1) Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ACM-VIT/open-with-browser.git
cd open-with-browser

# 2) Navigate to the app
cd apps/desktop

# 3) Install dependencies with Bun
bun install

# 4) Run the Tauri development server
bun run tauri dev

# Optional: using npm instead of Bun
# npm install
# npm run tauri dev
```

**Build a release installer (Windows .exe):**

```powershell
cd apps/desktop
bun run tauri build
```

---

### üêß Linux/macOS Setup (Bun + Tauri)

```bash
# 1) Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ACM-VIT/open-with-browser.git
cd open-with-browser

# 2) Go to the desktop app folder
cd apps/desktop

# 3) Install dependencies with Bun
bun install

# 4) Start the development environment
bun run tauri dev

# Or use npm if preferred
# npm install && npm run tauri dev
```

**Build release package (AppImage, .dmg, etc):**

```bash
cd apps/desktop
bun run tauri build
```

‚úÖ After successful build, check the `src-tauri/target/release/` directory for your compiled app.

---

## Usage (Planned)

1. Launch the app.
2. In Settings, register Open With Browser as your default handler for http/https.
3. Create a few rules (e.g., host: github.com ‚Üí Chrome [Coding]).
4. Click a link anywhere‚Äîmatching rules will route it automatically.
5. If unmatched, the ‚ÄúOpen With‚Äù dialog appears; choose a browser/profile:
   - Just once: open now, don‚Äôt save a rule
   - Always: open now and create a rule for next time

üí° Tip: You can import/export rules from Settings.
